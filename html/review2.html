        <img src="../images/intel1.webp" alt="intel processor" class="img-standard element-spacing">
        <h3 class="element-spacing">VERDICT</h3>
        <p class="element-spacing">The Intel Core i9-13900K has done something very significant in outperforming the 12th Gen 12900K by 
            a significant margin within just one generation. However, across a lot of benchmarks, 
            the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X maintains a lead over the 13900K. In a lot of benchmarks, the difference isn't much. 
            So for enthusiasts, there are now two very competitive high-end desktop processors to choose from. That's a good place to be in.</p>

        <h3 class="element-spacing">INTEL CORE I9-13900K DESKTOP PROCESSOR DETAILED REVIEW </h3>
        <p class="element-spacing">Intel 13th Gen Raptor Lake desktop processors have their work cut out for themselves.
             The 12th Gen Intel Alder Lake processors had finally brought Intel back to the front after lagging behind 
             AMD processors for some time, only to lose out the top spot to the recently launched AMD Zen 4 Raphael processors.
              So the 13th Gen processors have to outdo the Zen processors and that’s no easy task. 13th Gen Intel processors feature the same hybrid microarchitecture that the 12th Gen processors have but with a lot more E-Cores than before. The process node is the same Intel 7 process node or as it was previously known as Intel 10nm Enhanced Super Fin process but Intel claims to have made huge strides in performance to become much more power-efficient.

            The Z690 platform that had launched with Intel 12th Gen processors will be compatible with 
            the Intel 13th Gen processors but Intel has unveiled the new Z790 platform for performance enthusiasts. 
            The key differences being that the nativer DDR5 performance goes up to 5600 MT/s and a lot more PCIe Gen 4 lanes for 
            the PCH. Z690 had 12 Gen 4 PCIe lanes and 16 Gen 3 PCIe Lanes. Z790 makes that into 20 Gen 4 and 8 Gen 3 PCIe lanes. 
            So motherboard manufacturers get to be a lot more creative with the kind of interfaces and storage options that they can provide. 
        </p>

        <p class="element-spacing">

            Just like the previous gen, even the 13th Gen launch lineup will only have six processors at launch. There will be two SKUs under each performance tier – Core i9, Core i7 and Core i5. The Core i3 processors might launch later or may not. We have no word about that. The 12th Gen Core i3 processors launched after a significant amount of time after the initial launch period. However, considering that the Core i3 tier is more focused on budget processors, this is quite common even with AMD’s budget tiers. 

The six processors launching today are the K and KF processors. The KF processors are simply the K processors without the integrated GPU. Speaking of which, the integrated GPU is the same Intel UHD 770 graphics but the clock speeds have been bumped up by 100 MHz. So there will be a little bit of extra gaming performance for folks relying on the iGPU until they can get a decent discrete graphics card.

The bulk of the change with the 13th Gen Intel Raptor Lake processors is the doubling of the E-Cores. The 12th Gen processors had 8 E-Cores whereas the 13th Gen processors will be shipping with 16 E-Cores. The total thread count of the flagship Intel Core i9-13900K becomes 32 considering that all the P-Cores have hyperthreading whereas the E-Cores don’t.

        <h3 class="element-spacing">INTEL CORE I9-13900K AND CORE I5-13600K PERFORMANCE</h3>
        <p class="element-spacing">

            Don’t be taken in by the presence of efficient E-Cores on Intel 12th Gen Alder Lake processors. The Core i9-12900K has a max turbo power of 241 watts and motherboard manufacturers tend to ignore such limits to boost performance. So expect the high-end processors to guzzle power like there’s no tomorrow. We tested both, the top of the line Core i9-12900K and the mid-range Core i5-12600K.
